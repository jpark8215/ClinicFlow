# ClinicFlow - AI-Powered Clinical Operations

Welcome to ClinicFlow, a web application designed to streamline clinical operations using AI and automation. This project was bootstrapped with Lovable.

## Project Vision

ClinicFlow aims to be a comprehensive solution for healthcare providers, featuring:
- **Preauth Bot**: An automated system for handling prior authorizations with payers.
- **Smart Scheduling**: An intelligent appointment scheduler with forecasting capabilities.
- **Intake Automation**: A tool to digitize patient intake forms using OCR and integrate with EHRs.
- **No-Show Assistant**: A predictive model to mitigate patient no-shows and optimize calendar availability.

## MVP Overview (Current Version)

This initial version (MVP) establishes the foundational user interface and project structure.

### Key Features
- **Dashboard**: A central hub displaying key metrics and tasks.
- **Modular Components**: The UI is built with React and shadcn/ui, ensuring a clean and consistent design system.
- **Placeholder Data**: The dashboard is populated with dummy data to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Navigation**: A sidebar provides navigation to the different feature areas (currently placeholders).

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Charting**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, you need Node.js and npm installed.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3.  **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Development Roadmap

The following is a high-level roadmap for developing the full-featured application.

1.  **Backend Integration (Supabase)**:
    - Set up database tables for patients, appointments, etc.
    - Implement user authentication.
2.  **Smart Scheduling**:
    - Develop the calendar UI.
    - Integrate a forecasting model for appointment demand.
    - Implement an alert system.
3.  **Preauth Bot**:
    - Design the UI for tracking authorization status.
    - Build a secure connector to payer systems (requires external APIs).
4.  **Intake Automation**:
    - Integrate an OCR service to process documents.
    - Create a form validator.
    - Develop an EHR form-filling mechanism.
5.  **No-Show Assistant**:
    - Train a prediction model based on historical data.
    - Implement logic for auto-filling calendar gaps.
